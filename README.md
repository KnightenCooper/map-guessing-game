# map-guessing-game

The Map Guessing Game is designed to allow players to practice finding countries on each continent. The start menu pulls up and allows you to choose a continent. Once the map appears it will display a country for you to click on.  A timer will keep track of how fast the player can guess all the countries. When you are finished with the continent, your time will be displayed. There is also a leaderboard for the top ten times.
